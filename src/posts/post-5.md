This is some dummy copy. You’re not really supposed to read this dummy copy, it is just a place holder for people who need some type to visualize what the actual copy might look like if it were real content.

If you want to read, I might suggest a good book, perhaps [Hemingway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway "Hemingway") or [Melville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville "Melville"). That’s why they call it, the dummy copy. This, of course, is not the real copy for this entry. Rest assured, the words will expand the concept. With clarity. Conviction. And a little wit.

In today’s competitive [market environment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_environment "market environment"),
the body copy of your entry must lead the reader through a series of **disarmingly simple thoughts**.

All your supporting arguments must be communicated with simplicity and charm. And in such a way that the reader will read on. (After all, that’s a reader’s job: to read, isn’t it?) And by the time your readers have reached this point in the finished copy, you will have convinced them that you not only respect their intelligence, but you also **understand their needs as consumers**.

As a result of which, your entry will repay your [efforts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing "writing"). Take your sales; simply put, they will rise. Likewise your credibility. There’s every chance your competitors will wish they’d placed this entry, not you. While your customers will have probably forgotten that your competitors even exist. Which brings us, by a somewhat circuitous route, to another small point, but one which we feel should be raised.

### Long copy or short – You decide

As a marketer, you probably don’t even believe in body copy. **Let alone long body copy**. (Unless you have a long body yourself.) Well, truth is, who‘s to blame you? Fact is, too much long body copy is dotted with such indulgent little phrases like [truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "truth") is, fact is, and who’s to blame you. Trust us: we guarantee, with a hand over our heart, that no such indulgent rubbish will appear in your entry. That’s why God gave us big blue pencils. So we can expunge every example of witted waffle.
